Fueled by a global pandemic, we are seeing economic, cultural and social trends colliding.\n\nThis has led to a rapid transformation in how we work, where we work and even why we work. The only constant is change. And change that previously took decades, has happened in just two years. At Linkedin, we call this “The Great Reshuffle”.\n\nRunning in parallel with “The Great Reshuffle” is the world’s urgent need to save itself. Sir David Attenborough tells us “the future of humanity and indeed, all life on earth, now depends on us”.\n\nOur hope is that we can collectively turn the climate crisis into an opportunity for change. We can all help save the planet by creating and pursuing greener careers for the world’s workforce. This green transition can see existing jobs apply more green skills and new green jobs emerge in tandem.\n\nSuch jobs include Sustainability Manager, Wind Turbine Technician, Solar Consultant, Ecologist, Environmental Health & Safety Specialist: roles that barely existed just a decade ago yet today are the five fastest-growing green jobs globally.\n\nSo what does this mean for you? How can you get yourself ready for the green economy that lies ahead?\n\nIn my LinkedIn Learning course, Closing the Green Skills Gap to Power a Greener Economy, I’ll help you better understand the green transition and the opportunities it presents. You’ll learn more about green skills and understand the rise of green jobs. I’ll look at what different countries and sectors are doing to lead green change. I’ll also give practical advice about what you can do to embrace and take advantage of this rapid economic shift. Watch this course for free until May 19, 2022. \n\nRemember - change starts with you! So whether you’re taking the first steps in your career or looking for a new challenge in your existing one, here are three things you can do to turbocharge your career in the green economy.\n\nUpskill for green skills and green careers\nImproving your green skills is important to pursue emerging career opportunities. Globally, members with green skills have been more resilient to economic downturns than the rest of the workforce. So improving or adding to your green skills is a great place to start. You could consider self-directed learning, offline or online. You could also enroll in a green-related higher education course to help you upskill.\n\nMeanwhile, in the workplace, you could brush up on green skills as part of your organization's learning curriculum. Why not ask your employer or organization what green skills training may be available and even how you could volunteer to help make it happen?\n\nNurture your network of green skilled workers\nYour network is something you can’t put a price on. That’s because you’ve built it by nurturing relationships and showcasing your capabilities. But you need to keep it up!\n\nIndeed our data shows that green skilled workers tend to have stronger networks, with two and sometimes three times more connections on average. Your network is the way to build new relationships, ignite conversations and find new opportunities.\n\nSo start seeking out ‘green’ related content that interests you and consider engaging with it, for example, by commenting on it or sharing it. \n\nWhy not join a LinkedIn Group dedicated to a green topic that you’re passionate about? And if you’re feeling more adventurous, you can even set up your own LinkedIn group, especially if you can’t find a green topic specific to your job.\n\nThat way, you’ll ignite new conversations which could present new green opportunities for not only you but also your network.\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.341184Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.341557Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.366504Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.341520Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.365424Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"code","source":"len(sample_text.split())","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.368600Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.368898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.393299Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.368874Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-18T14:00:55.392237Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":27,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"606"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"string_parser
